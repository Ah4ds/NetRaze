# NetRaze — Agent Guide

> This file is written for AI coding agents. It assumes you know Rust and Cargo but nothing about this specific project.

---

## Project Overview

**NetRaze** is an offensive network-execution toolkit written in pure Rust. It is the spiritual successor to the Python tools NetExec / CrackMapExec — same workflow (enumerate, authenticate, execute, post-exploit), but rebuilt for:

- **Single native binaries** — no Python runtime or native extension hell; static linking is not the default build mode.
- **Async I/O from the ground up** — `tokio` across the entire stack.
- **Memory-safe wire protocols** — SMB2, NTLMSSP, and DCE/RPC are re-implemented in Rust and validated byte-for-byte against Impacket-generated fixtures. No FFI to Impacket or Samba libraries.
- **Cross-platform attacker OS** — Linux and Windows are equally capable attacker platforms. The cross-platform portage is complete: every SMB capability is pure Rust, and the `windows` crate is no longer a dependency of any protocol crate.

**Status:** Alpha. SMB2 + NTLMv2 (including anonymous null sessions and guest access) are the most mature protocols; the SMB post-exploitation surface (share/user enumeration, file browser, smbexec, SAM/LSA dump, AV enum) is fully ported and covered by the Samba integration harness. LDAP supports NTLMv2 SASL sign-and-seal, anonymous bind, RootDSE, paged AD user enumeration, read-only directory inventory, and BloodHound Community Edition schema-v6 JSON/ZIP export. Kerberos provides bounded UDP/TCP KDC transport, password/NT-hash/AES TGT acquisition, ccache v4/kirbi import and protected export, exact ticket-backed SMB/LDAP sessions, allowlisted realm referrals, S4U2Self/S4U2Proxy, explicit ticket construction, LDAP-assisted AS-REP/service-ticket assessment, and explicit artifact export. Deeper LDAP security probes, SMB 3.x, and multi-realm live fixtures remain future work (see `docs/protocol-stack-plan.md`).

**License:** BSD-2-Clause.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Rust, edition 2024, MSRV 1.85.
- **Toolchain:** Stable Rust with `clippy` and `rustfmt` components (see `rust-toolchain.toml`).
- **Async runtime:** `tokio` (`rt-multi-thread`, `macros`, `signal`, `sync`, `time`).
- **CLI framework:** `clap` with derive macros.
- **Desktop GUI:** `egui` + `eframe` with the `wgpu` backend (not the default `glow` / OpenGL). `wgpu` is configured with `dx12`, `vulkan`, `metal`, `gles`, and `wgsl` features for cross-platform and headless/WSL compatibility.
- **Serialization:** `serde` + `serde_json`.
- **Diagnostics:** `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber`.
- **Crypto:** `aes`, `cbc`, `cipher`, `des`, `hmac`, `md-5`, `md4`, `rand`.
- **Kerberos ASN.1/crypto:** `picky-asn1`, `picky-asn1-der`, `picky-krb`, `ccache-io`, and `ms-pac-forge`; NetRaze supplies bounded UDP/TCP exchange validation plus the RC4-HMAC profile omitted by the dependency.
- **Graph / workflow UI:** `egui-snarl` (node graph), `egui_graphs`, `petgraph`.
- **BloodHound CE adapter:** `rusthound-ce` 2.5.14 with `nogssapi`; NetRaze supplies the LDAP/NTLM transport and uses the dependency for CE object/relationship parsing and schema-v6 output.

## Workspace Structure

This is a Cargo workspace with 14 members (13 application crates + `xtask`).

### Crate Map

| Crate | Purpose | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `netraze-core` | Domain contracts, shared types, traits, error types. | **Zero applicative dependencies.** Defines `ProtocolFactory`, `ModuleFactory`, `ScanRequest`, `Capability`, `NetRazeError`. |
| `netraze-app` | Composition root / service wiring. | The only crate allowed to know almost everything. Bootstraps registries, storage, output, config, and runtime. |
| `netraze-cli` | Thin CLI binary (`clap`). | **Must contain zero protocol logic.** Entry point for headless use. |
| `netraze-desktop` | `egui`/`eframe` GUI with node-graph workflow canvas. | Binary crate. Uses `wgpu` backend and `egui-snarl` for visual workflows. |
| `netraze-protocols` | Wire-level protocol handlers. | SMB, LDAP/NTLM, and Kerberos are implemented in pure Rust. The BloodHound CE adapter also lives under this crate, not in separate workspace crates. SSH, WinRM, RDP, FTP, MSSQL, NFS, VNC, and WMI remain scaffold-only. |
| `netraze-dcerpc` | Pure-Rust DCE/RPC v5 stack. | NDR20, PDU framing, NTLMSSP auth verifier, interfaces: SRVSVC, SAMR, WINREG, SCMR. No `cfg(windows)` allowed inside this crate. |
| `netraze-modules` | Post-exploitation module registry. | Categories: `active_directory`, `credentials`, `reconnaissance`. |
| `netraze-auth` | Credential types and authentication methods. | `CredentialSet`, `SecretMaterial`, `AuthMethod`. |
| `netraze-targets` | Target parsing and normalization. | Detects hostnames, IPs, CIDRs, file lists, Nmap XML, Nessus files. |
| `netraze-config` | App / workspace / runtime configuration. | `AppConfig`, `WorkspaceConfig`, `RuntimeConfig`, `LoggingConfig`. |
| `netraze-storage` | Workspace persistence trait. | Async trait `WorkspaceStore`. In-memory impl today; SQLite backend planned. |
| `netraze-output` | Console reporting and output events. | `OutputEvent`, `Reporter` trait, `ConsoleReporter` bridges to `tracing`. |
| `netraze-runtime` | Concurrency, timeouts, async orchestration. | `RuntimeProfile` with bounded thread limits. |
| `xtask` | Build automation stub. | Currently a placeholder. Cargo alias `cargo xtask` maps to `cargo run -p xtask --`. |

### Dependency Rules (enforced in code review)

- `netraze-core` depends on **no** applicative crate.
- `netraze-cli` contains **no** protocol logic.
- `netraze-protocols` and `netraze-modules` depend only on `netraze-core` (and transversals), never on the CLI.
- `netraze-app` is the **only** crate allowed to know almost everything.
- Shared logic ratchets *up* into `netraze-core` or a transversal crate — never stays buried in a protocol crate.

## Build and Test Commands

### Daily Development

```bash
# Type-check the entire workspace
cargo check --workspace --all-targets

# Run all unit + integration tests (excludes #[ignore] tests)
cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast

# Format everything
cargo fmt --all

# Strict lint gate for the new pure-Rust DCE/RPC stack
cargo clippy -p netraze-dcerpc --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Advisory lint on the full workspace (legacy crates have pre-existing warnings)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```

### Release Builds

```bash
cargo build --release
# CLI binary:  target/release/netraze-cli
# GUI binary:  target/release/netraze-desktop
```

### Per-Crate Testing

```bash
# NDR / PDU / NTLMSSP / interface unit tests
cargo test -p netraze-dcerpc

# SMB crypto, LDAP/NTLM, Kerberos, framing, filter, and dispatcher tests
cargo test -p netraze-protocols
```

### Linux GUI Prerequisites

The desktop GUI links against X11 / Wayland / GTK headers. On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
  libx11-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev \
  libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev \
  libwayland-dev libgtk-3-dev build-essential pkg-config
```

The CLI-only build needs none of these.

---

## Testing Strategy

NetRaze uses known-answer vectors, pinned byte fixtures, and isolated live
harnesses for the implemented SMB/DCE-RPC, LDAP/NTLM, and Kerberos stacks:

### 1. Known-Answer Crypto Vectors

NTLMv2 response computation, NTOWFv2, SIGN/SEAL key derivation, and RC4 keystream are validated against MS-NLMP test vectors. Kerberos RC4-HMAC encryption/checksums and AES string-to-key use pinned Impacket/RFC vectors. These are fast unit tests that run on every `cargo test`.

### 2. Impacket-Pinned Byte Fixtures

Python scripts in `crates/netraze-dcerpc/tests/` (e.g., `gen_srvs_fixture.py`) and `crates/netraze-protocols/tests/gen_ldap_fixtures.py` use Impacket to generate reference bytes. The generated bytes are baked into Rust tests; ordinary `cargo test` does **not** need Python/Impacket. LDAP also has loopback tests for BER framing, bind state, message IDs, paging, and filter parsing.

### 3. Live Samba Integration Harness

Directory: `tests/samba/`

- `docker-compose.yml` spins `ghcr.io/servercontainers/samba:smbd-only-latest` on `127.0.0.1:1445` (high port to avoid colliding with the host OS SMB client).
- `smb.conf` defines a pinned share inventory with user `alice` in workgroup `NETRAZE`. `NETRAZE_SAMBA_PASSWORD` must be generated in the caller's environment and is shared by Compose and the Rust tests. Wrong passwords map onto the guest account (`map to guest = Bad Password`), which is what exercises the guest paths. Share names and comments are **load-bearing** — Rust tests assert on them exactly.
- SMB integration tests live in `crates/netraze-protocols/tests/` (`samba_integration`, `rpc_channel_samba`, `shares_rpc_samba`, `info_rpc_samba`, `users_rpc_samba`, `browser_ops_samba`, `exec_samba`, `enum_av_samba`, `anonymous_samba`) and are `#[ignore]` by default.

Run locally:

```bash
# Start the container
export NETRAZE_SAMBA_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
docker compose -f tests/samba/docker-compose.yml up -d --wait

# Select only the nine SMB suites; the separate LDAP suite needs a different DC
cargo test -p netraze-protocols \
  --test samba_integration --test rpc_channel_samba --test shares_rpc_samba \
  --test info_rpc_samba --test users_rpc_samba --test browser_ops_samba \
  --test exec_samba --test enum_av_samba --test anonymous_samba \
  -- --ignored --test-threads=1

# Tear down
docker compose -f tests/samba/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

Environment variable `NETRAZE_SAMBA_ADDR` defaults to `127.0.0.1:1445` and can be overridden to point at a custom endpoint.

**Impacket cross-check is a standing rule:** when SMB wire behaviour changes, verify the new behaviour against Impacket running against the same harness before committing, and pin the result in a test. Several suites carry comments noting "identical to Impacket" for exactly this reason.

### 4. Local Samba AD LDAP/Kerberos Harness

Directory: `tests/samba-ad/` (separate from the SMB fixture).

- The digest-pinned Samba AD DC exposes LDAP on `127.0.0.1:1389`, SMB on `127.0.0.1:2445`, and its TCP/UDP KDC on `127.0.0.1:1088`; test accounts and domain data are disposable fixtures, while passwords are injected from `NETRAZE_SAMBA_AD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `NETRAZE_SAMBA_AD_PASSWORD` at runtime.
- `ldap_samba_ad` is ignored by default. Its seven tests exercise NTLM password and NT-hash bind, required sign-and-seal, RootDSE, multi-page users, the complete read-only inventory (groups, computers, OUs, topology, privileged principals, SPNs, reported security settings), and BloodHound CE schema-v6 JSON/ZIP export across the Schema, default-domain, and Configuration naming contexts. They also check anonymous RootDSE access, wrong-password and Guest rejection, protected escaped-filter search, and returned referrals.
- `kerberos_samba_ad` is also ignored by default. Its six tests cover password/AES TGT acquisition over normal and UDP-only transport, wrong-password rejection, LDAP-discovered AS-REP and service-SPN candidates, AS/TGS artifact collection, ccache/kirbi round trips, and imported-ticket LDAP/SMB sessions. The pinned MIT-backed KDC rejects RC4-only AS requests by policy, so the live suite asserts that explicit error while deterministic loopback exchanges validate successful NT-hash/RC4 pre-authentication, realm referrals, and S4U.
- It has a fixed loopback endpoint and no environment override. Anonymous bind is covered by both a loopback mock-server test and a live RootDSE assertion against the local Samba AD DC; anonymous domain-wide enumeration is not asserted. Do not add real-environment credentials or targets to tests.

```bash
export NETRAZE_SAMBA_AD_ADMIN_PASSWORD="Aa1!$(openssl rand -hex 20)"
export NETRAZE_SAMBA_AD_PASSWORD="Aa1!$(openssl rand -hex 20)"
docker compose -f tests/samba-ad/docker-compose.yml up -d --wait
cargo test -p netraze-protocols \
  --test ldap_samba_ad --test kerberos_samba_ad \
  -- --ignored --test-threads=1
docker compose -f tests/samba-ad/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

Only tear down a harness you started for this run; `down -v` deletes its disposable test volume.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions ships a single workflow: [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).

- **Trigger:** pushing a `v*` tag (`git tag v0.1.1 && git push origin v0.1.1`).
- **Build:** `cargo build --release -p netraze-desktop` on native Ubuntu and Windows runners, packaged as `netraze-desktop-{linux,windows}-x86_64` archives.
- **Release:** binaries are attached to a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes.

The fmt / clippy / test gates are not enforced by CI today — run them locally before pushing (see Quick Reference). The strict clippy gate (`-D warnings`) applies to `netraze-dcerpc`.

---

## Code Style Guidelines

### Tooling

- `rustfmt` for formatting. Run `cargo fmt --all` before committing.
- `clippy` with workspace-level lints:
  - `clippy::pedantic` enabled at `warn` level.
  - `module_name_repetitions`, `missing_errors_doc`, `missing_panics_doc` explicitly allowed.

### Documentation Style

- **Module-level docs (`//!`) are extensive** and explain the wire-protocol context. Expect to see references like `MS-SRVS §3.1.4`, `MS-RPCE §2.2.2.13`, `MS-SMB2 §2.2.13`.
- **Comments explain *why*, not just *what*.** They often reference the original spec subtlety or bug that motivated a layout decision (e.g., "the union's tag=1 arm is a *pointer*, not an inline container — missing that pointer level was the original decoder bug").
- **English** is the language of code comments and commit messages. `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/protocol-stack-plan.md` are existing French documents; preserve their language when editing them.

### Naming and Structure

- Follow standard Rust naming (`PascalCase` for types/traits, `snake_case` for functions/variables/modules, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants).
- **Credential shape carries auth intent** in `SmbCredential`: empty username → anonymous null session; username with no hash and no password → guest; anything else → strict password/pass-the-hash (a wrong password is *rejected*, never silently downgraded to guest). Guest and null sessions bind DCE/RPC unauthenticated over the SMB session (Impacket parity) — see `smb/rpc.rs::bind_interface_over_smb`.
- **LDAP authorization is explicit:** a named account uses NTLMv2 SASL/SPNEGO sign-and-seal with a password or NT hash; an empty-name/empty-password bind is anonymous and unprotected. `Guest` with an empty password is a named NTLM attempt, not a fallback. LDAP referrals are reported, never chased with credentials.
- **Kerberos secrets stay explicit:** passwords, NT hashes, AES keys, imported ticket session keys, and ticket-construction keys never appear in `Debug` or workspace serialization. CLI keys come from named environment variables. Acquired/imported tickets remain in memory unless the operator explicitly exports ccache/kirbi; ticket and roast exports use mode 0600 on Unix. Workspaces persist only a selected ticket path and exact service host.
- **Desktop scan credentials:** blank Configuration fields reuse each target host's current `Login As` credential, or anonymous when none exists. Entered credentials override the host login and are upserted into Credential Manager. The workflow login menu deduplicates session and saved copies by identity; session copies take precedence. Workspace saves serialize Credential Manager secrets, so do not commit workspace JSON containing real credentials.
- Sanity caps on untrusted input allocations (e.g., `MAX_SHARES_PER_RESPONSE = 65_536`, `64 KiB` wstring cap) to prevent malicious server inputs from forcing huge allocations.

---

## Security Considerations

1. **This is offensive security software.** It is intended exclusively for authorized security assessments — your own infrastructure, engagements covered by a signed statement of work, or purpose-built lab environments. Running it against systems you do not own or do not have explicit written permission to test is illegal.

2. **Test credentials are ephemeral.** Both Samba harnesses require caller-generated passwords through environment variables and store no working password in Git. Never reuse those generated values outside their disposable loopback harness.

3. **No `unsafe` Rust policy:** There is no project-wide ban on `unsafe`, but the wire-protocol crates (`netraze-dcerpc`, `netraze-protocols::smb2`) are written entirely in safe Rust. Any introduction of `unsafe` should be justified and documented.

4. **Strict auth semantics:** a credential carrying a secret must never accept a server-downgraded GUEST/NULL session — the error ("downgraded to GUEST") is the security property, pinned by tests in `anonymous_samba`.

5. **Workspace files contain secrets.** Credentials entered in Configuration are added to Credential Manager, and workspace JSON saves include its passwords/NT hashes. Treat workspace files as sensitive and keep them out of repository artifacts.

## Cross-Platform Portage Plan (Complete)

NetRaze inherited two implementation strategies for SMB post-exploitation.
The migration from Windows-native APIs to the pure-Rust SMB2 + DCE/RPC
stack is **finished** — every phase below is done, the Windows-native
files and `smb/stubs/` are deleted, and the `windows` crate is no longer
a dependency of `netraze-protocols`:

| Strategy | Where it lives | Portability |
|---|---|---|
| **Pure-Rust SMB2 + DCE/RPC** (the only strategy left) | `crates/netraze-protocols/src/smb/*.rs` and `netraze-dcerpc/` | Any attacker OS |

- **Phase 1** (Done) — Pure-Rust SMB2 wire foundation: Negotiate, NTLMv2, TreeConnect.
- **Phase 2** (Done) — DCE/RPC primitives: NDR20, PDU framing, NTLMSSP auth verifier, MS-SRVS `NetrShareEnum`.
- **Phase 3** (Done) — `FSCTL_PIPE_TRANSCEIVE` over SMB2 (`rpc::SmbPipeTransport`).
- **Phase 4** (Done) — Read-only modules: `info`, `shares`, `users`.
- **Phase 5** (Done) — Write-side modules: `exec` (smbexec via SVCCTL), `browser` (file ops over SMB2).
- **Phase 6** (Done) — Secret dumping: `dump` (SAM/LSA via WINREG + hive parser).
- **Phase 7** (Done) — Windows-native code path retired; single pure-Rust implementation everywhere.
- **Follow-up** (Done) — Anonymous null-session and guest access across the stack (credential-shape dispatch, unauthenticated DCE binds for guest/null sessions), plus the tag-driven release workflow.

**What this means for agents:**
- If you modify `netraze-dcerpc` or `netraze-protocols::smb`, run the nine explicitly selected SMB suites shown above; `cargo test -p netraze-protocols -- --ignored` also selects the separate LDAP AD suite and is not an SMB-only command. Cross-check SMB wire behaviour changes against Impacket.
- If you modify `netraze-protocols::ldap` or its NTLM SASL path, run its unit tests and the ignored `ldap_samba_ad` suite against the local Samba AD harness. Do not redirect the fixed-endpoint suite to a real AD environment.
- If you modify `netraze-protocols::kerberos`, run its unit/loopback tests and the ignored `kerberos_samba_ad` suite against the same fixed-loopback Samba AD harness. Run `ldap_samba_ad` too when LDAP target discovery changes.
- If you add a new DCE/RPC interface, follow the fixture pattern: write a `gen_*.py` script that uses Impacket to generate bytes, paste the bytes into a Rust test, and add a round-trip test.
- Never re-introduce `#[cfg(windows)]` protocol paths in `netraze-protocols` or any `cfg`-gating in `netraze-dcerpc` — those crates are 100% cross-platform by policy.
